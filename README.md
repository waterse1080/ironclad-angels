# Ironclad Angels
This is the public repository for my vehicle roguelike Ironclad Angels, which started development in May 2024. The current build can be played here: https://eliot-waters.itch.io/ironclad-angels

The main development repository cannot be made public due to the use of purchased audio and visual assets that cannot be freely redistributed. I have made this separate repository to showcase my work in GDScript. 
As such, third-party add-ons have also been omitted, so some files may not work correctly without modification if loaded into a new Godot project.

I plan to update this along with all future public version releases, with the potential to include any of my other work on the project, such as my own art and audio.

Anything uploaded to this repository may be freely copied, modified, and redistributed.
