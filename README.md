# ironclad-angels
A public repository for the game Ironclad Angels for showcasing my work within the game Godot engine.
The main game repo cannot be made public due to the use of audio and visual assets that cannot be freely redistributed.
Third-party add-ons have also been omitted. Some files may not work correctly when loaded into a new Godot project.
